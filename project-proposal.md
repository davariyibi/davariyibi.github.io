In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context. Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims. If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

### Motivation
Language is best learned in the wild! But not all of us are that adventurous. Classes only do so much for (especially if that is the only place you practice), and studying abroad does not last forever. In my journey towards learning new languages, I personally have fallen victim to only being able to study right before and during class. I make promises to myself about practicing flash cards as well as waking up early to study more but time is not on my side. The problem persists of many students taking foreign languages not getting enough exposure outside of class. This coupled with the increasing workloads and extracurriculars, learning a new language is stunted by how much we communicate in ways counterproductive to our learning goals.

### Context
In terms of learning languages
