### Why the Eph Network?
The Eph Network is a highly under-utilized resource offered by the school for current students and alumni in order to connect with each other. Despite being a service pushed by the Career Center, it is still only used by a small margin of the current Williams student body. I think this is partially due to its poor design.

 **Issues:**
  - Actual process of finding the Eph Network on the Alumni page is not intuitive
  - Despite having to log in to access the network anyway, link seems to be almost hidden and is amongst similarly titled links, which adds to confusion

 - First click on 'ALUMNI/CAREER DIRECTORY'

 - Then click on the text 'Search the Alumni/Career Directory' ('Click Here' was recently added due to complaints of not being able to find the network directory, but the text itself doesn't actually do anything. Another design flaw and point of confusion)

The directory itself is not a bad design. It is very minimalist in its design and is pretty intuitive. However even if the product works well, if you can't get to it, the purpose is defeated.
