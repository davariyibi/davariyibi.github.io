### Why the Map?
When I first got on the Williams College campus the spring of senior year, despite the campus being small, I needed a way to figure out where I was and where I was going. I found the app relatively easily through the main site and immediately knew what to do from there. Since good design is characterized by ease-of-use, the quickness of easily grasping what I needed is a large plus.

 **Locating where I was:**
  - Campus grounds are colored and differentiated from rest of map, so easier to spot landmarks
  - Tourist spots were pointed to from the very beginning

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
