Hello! I am a student at Williams College, where I am double-majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am really interested in Theoretical Computer Science/Applied Mathematics, but I am no stranger to the rest of the tech world. I at least try and keep my doors open. I'm pretty sure if you've found this page, you have (or can) also found my info, so please reach out! I love talking to people with cool ideas/opportunities! (If for some reason you can't find my info, my LinkedIn should be linked below.)
