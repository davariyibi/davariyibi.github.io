*Human-Computer Interaction, the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for successful interaction with human beings.* - [Margaret Rouse](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/HCI-human-computer-interaction)

I think this definition eloquently defines the two sides of the scale for which the study hopes to balance as well as the two historically separate disciplines for which the study effectively combines. In the process of choosing to take a class focusing on design and the design process, everything I knew about design on a personal level was from emulating real-world designs I thought were interesting. Design to me felt more like of an abstract art than a quantifiable, measurable aspect of accomplishing a task, both of which I now see more clearly. In my journey from start to finish, I participated in the design project, Sous Shopper, focusing as much on the process of designing it as to actually designing the product.

1. Understand the problem at its root
2. Define your ethical position responsibly
3. Keep user accessibility in mind
4. Churn out iterations
5. Collect and review feedback

### Understanding the Problem
Understanding any problem at its root in my opinion is the most effective way of solving the problem. However, the scope of the problem is rarely only what needs to be completed but is overwhelmingly involving who is needing the task to be completed as well as how and why they need to complete it.


### Ethics
Among the biggest subjects in what should influence design

At this phase in design, once you have dug deep into the problem at hand and have some grasp at what the general form of a solution should look like, the next step is to set up boundaries for yourself before going forward. This cannot be stressed enough, because a leap in the wrong direction this early in the design process will have much larger cascading effects by the time the flaw is eventually pointed out.

### Accessibility
As to why topics like iteration are so far back, I believe accessibility of a solution should be part of the original design and not an afterthought or add-on needing to be checked


### Iterate


### Feedback
