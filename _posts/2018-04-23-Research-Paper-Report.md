*Does Multitasking with Mobile Phones Affect Learning? A Review* is a paper which interprets an amalgamation of other papers, experiments, and studies. It uses the information gathered to focus on the question of how the use of mobile devices either help or impair learning, specifically how *mobile phone multitasking* influences academic performance. Mobile phone multitasking is defined essentially as when one's attention is divided between what they are trying to learn, be it from reading a book to taking notes in a lecture, and some off-task use of their mobile phone. This includes the act of rapidly switching between learning and attending to their mobile phone as well. The paper builds off this definition and other observations to get to its main conclusions: mobile phone multitasking overloads the mind trying to focus on more than one different streams of information, so the retention of the less immediately important information is diminished, or mobile phone multitasking puts the user in a state of continuous partial attention, where they can not even fully focus on any one source of information and end up performing poorly in all areas. I agree with both interpretations as well as focus on some of the observations made towards reducing these negative outcomes.

While the paper presents a dichotomy between mobile-based learning and distractions caused by mobile phone multitasking, Sous Shopper hopes to heighten the former while minimizing the latter. As a tool, Sous Shopper is meant to be an application users actively learn from, especially while out in the world. Optimistically, the application should fit seamlessly into one's shopping experience without causing so much of a distraction as to significantly increase one's time spent in the store/market. However, since the application is also meant for learning, there must be some focus on the information provided from the app. Thus a design which strikes a balance on just how much information is shown at a time as well as what the best or fastest way of getting the relevant information across is very important. If a user is using the app while at a grocery store or farmers market, they are multitasking, and the paper sheds light on ways to minimize the effects on speed and overall learning, so that users can make quicker decisions about their produce. An addition to the design that fit right into one of the observations of the paper is the amount of images in the design of the app. If the user is already focused on looking for various items, having the multitasking be essentially the same actions, especially when it directly assists the main goal, makes it less of a distraction and can bolster better learning. That and switching from the blocks of text that would have originally been shown in the app to the freshness and ripeness page cuts down on the amount of stopping and reading. One aspect that could have been added to further help with mobile phone multitasking but is not currently provided is audio assistance. The paper emphasises that utilizing different sensory inputs over more of the same is more effective with multitasking and divided attention. In respect to the app, while the user is already using their eyes to look around in the store/farmers market, instead of always drawing their eyes away and towards their phone, audio can relay the information instead, especially when the information is not necessarily sight-based. Determining produce ripeness and freshness is many times a combination of looks, feel, sound, and smell, thus the user would have had to stop and read if the information was only on-screen.
