### Motivation
Language is best learned in the wild! But not all of us are that adventurous. Classes only do so much for (especially if that is the only place you practice), and studying abroad does not last forever. In my journey towards learning new languages, I personally have fallen victim to only being able to study right before and during class. I make promises to myself about practicing flash cards as well as waking up early to study more but time is not on my side. The problem persists of many students taking foreign languages not getting enough exposure outside of class. This coupled with the increasing workloads and extracurriculars, learning a new language is stunted by how much we communicate in ways counterproductive to our learning goals.

### Proposal
["Language is a cognition that truly makes us human."](https://www.simplypsychology.org/language.html) - Henna Lemetyinen

In terms of the importance of learning languages, it opens one up to yet another piece of the world, originally unavailable to your interpretation. An entire group of people, now much more accessible than ever before. Communication, now without the aid of a translator.

I simply propose an alarm. Not one that just wakes you up in the morning but one that challenges you as you wake. The alarm gives the user quick quizzes or puzzles to solve in order to disable the sound. Flashcards of relevant study information can be written in to be tested on in each day. There are many similarities to aspects of the alarm. The largest, fastest-growing language acquisition program since Rosetta Stone, Duolingo has many short mind games and study material available in many different languages.

Some alarms themselves already require problem-solving in order for them to be disabled. These range from simple matching games to math problems.

Also, flashcard apps like Quizlet lead the mobile sector in terms of quizzes, specialized learning plans, and the sheer amount of vetted, crowdsourced learning material.

### Inspiration
Inspiration came from brainstorming session in HCI class 02/08/2018 as well as talks with friends.
